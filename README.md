Unlock the power of automation and learning in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. Graph X-Ray is a developer tool that demystifies the Microsoft admin portals by revealing the exact Microsoft Graph API calls being made in the background as you work.

Stop spending hours digging through documentation to figure out how to automate a task. Simply perform the action in the portal, and Graph X-Ray will provide you with the corresponding, ready-to-use script. It's the ultimate "learn by doing" tool for Microsoft Graph.

### Manual Install

To manually install the Graph X-Ray extension, download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/merill/graphxray/releases) and follow the instructions for your browser.

- Download the latest `.zip` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/merill/graphxray/releases).
- Extract the contents of the `.zip` file.
- Open your browser and navigate to
  - Microsoft Edge: `edge://extensions`
  - Google Chrome: `chrome://extensions`
- Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch (usually in the bottom left or top right corner).
- Click on "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder.

## Supported Microsoft Graph Endpoints

The extension detects and generates code snippets for Microsoft Graph calls across:

- **graph.microsoft.com** (Public cloud)
- **graph.microsoft.us** (US Government cloud - GCC High)
- **dod-graph.microsoft.us** (US Department of Defense)
- **microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn** (China cloud)

## Supported Microsoft Admin Portal Environments

The extension works with any web page that makes Graph API calls. We've primarily tested with

- Microsoft Entra
- Microsoft Intune

If there are admin portals where you are not seeing Graph X-Ray work as expected, please open an [issue](https://github.com/merill/graphxray/issues), even better, submit a pull request by following the steps in [Adding non-Graph API calls to Ultra X-Ray](#adding-non-graph-api-calls-to-ultra-x-ray).

## Using Graph X-Ray

### Viewing the Graph call stack trace

To view Graph calls in real-time:

- Browse to the **Microsoft admin portal (Entra, Intune...)**
- Open **Developer Tools**
- Open the **Graph X-Ray panel** in Developer Tools
- Make changes in the portal to record and view the corresponding Graph API calls and PowerShell commands

![Demo of opening Graph X-Ray panel](./public/img/tutorial/graphxraydemo.gif)

### Step by step guide

#### Open Developer Tools

##### Using the keyboard

- Press **F12** on Windows
- Press **Cmd+Opt+I** on macOS

##### Using the menu

- On Microsoft Edge open the menu from the top right then select **Extensions**
- On Google Chrome open the menu from the top right then select **More Tools** and click **Extensions**

#### Open the Graph X-Ray panel

Expand the tabs in Developer Tools and select the Graph X-Ray panel.

If you don't see the Graph X-Ray panel you may need to restart your browser.

#### View Graph call stack trace

Make changes in the Azure Portal to view the corresponding Graph API calls and PowerShell commands for the action (e.g. edit a user's profile information and click Save).

Scroll down in the Graph X-Ray panel to view the new stack trace.

## Developer Guide

### Pre-requisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies

### Develop in a VS Code Dev Container

If you are using the VS Code Dev Containers feature, reopen the repository in the container from the Command Palette. The container installs dependencies with `npm ci` on first create, keeps `node_modules` in a named Docker volume so Linux container artifacts do not pollute the Windows checkout, and forwards the webpack dev server port automatically.

Run `npm start` inside the container to compile and debug. The development server listens on `http://localhost:4000`.

### Build the extension

`npm start` to compile and debug

To load the extension, go to chrome://extensions or edge://extensions, turn on developer mode, click on "load unpacked", and navigate to the ./dev folder.

### Production build

Production builds are automatically created in GitHub with the right version number.

If you want to create a production build of the extension on your desktop, run `npm run build`.

The build artifacts will be placed in the `build` folder.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Adding non-Graph API calls to Ultra X-Ray

Ultra X-Ray shows calls to non-Graph API endpoints. Unfortunately, we need to explicitly add each endpoint to the extension.

To add support for a new endpoint.

1. **Figure out the API endpoint** - View the network requests in the browser's developer tools and find out the domain where the API is hosted.
1. **Add domain to [domains.js](./src/common/domains.js)** - Add the new domain to the list of domains in the `domains.js` file.
1. **Add domain to [manifest.json](./src/public/manifest.json)** - Note the manifest requires the / at the end of the domain.
1. **Test the endpoint** - Make a request to the new blade and verify that it appears in Graph X-Ray.
